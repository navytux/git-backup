This repository is not corrupt. However it can be configured to force `git
pack-objects` to send valid, but incomplete pack(*). This is needed to test that
a fetcher really verifies whether it got complete pack after fetching from a
repository.

There are 2 scenarios to prepare incomplete pack:

1. x-missing-blob: drop a blob object from the pack,
2. x-commit-send-parent: generate a pack starting from only a parent of requested tip.

To activate a scenario one have to export HOME=<this-repository>/<scenario>

See x-missing-blob/ and x-commit-send-parent/ for details.
See also https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/git/git.git/commit/?h=6d4bb3833c for related check in `git fetch`.

(*) git pack-objects is adjusted at runtime via uploadpack.packObjectsHook:
